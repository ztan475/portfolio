        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">I am currently a student studing Computer Science and English: Creative 
            Writing. I am passionate about the merging the sciences and the arts, as well as these subjects on their own. Some of 
            the things I enjoy are making and playing music, writing short stories and poems, developing and learning about 
            artificial intelligence, and making games.
