            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>

            <p>
                Hello! I’m Zachary Tan, a student at the University of Rochester double majoring in Computer Science and 
                English: Creative Writing. I am passionate about the combination of science and art, and I enjoy exploring 
                the different ways these subjects can work together.
            </p>

            <p>
                My interests span a wide range of disciplines, from artificial intelligence and game development to writing 
                short stories and poems. Beyond academics, I find joy in arranging and playing the piano, which often fuels my 
                creativity and inspires my projects.
            </p>

            <p>                
                Whether I’m coding a new game, experimenting with AI models, or writing imaginative worlds into existence, I’m 
                constantly driven by curiosity and the desire to create meaningful, engaging experiences. My goal is to merge 
                technical innovation with storytelling to craft work that resonates emotionally and intellectually.
