                            Made with Games For Love where I collaborated with a team of interns to create a story based collection
                            of arcade games. The player is stranded on an undiscovered planet, and is trying to escape. They must face 
                            challenges put forth by he planet's inhabitants, in a brick breaker style mini game. Tiles have different 
                            effects such as slowing down the ball, shrinking or enlargening the player, and more. I implemented and wrote 
                            the story, designed the menus and UI, and performed bug fixes. This was made in Unity using C#. There are multiple 
                            levels with different gameplay mechanics, and that augment the story with player interaction.

                            platformer where the player plays as a chicken drumstick, and is trying to escape the kitchen. 
                            It was made in Unity using C#, and I implemented UI design, menus, and player interactability.
                            There are 3 levels, with each one introducing a new mechanic. I worked in both script writing and design.
